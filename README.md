Mechanic Used in project: Shooting

What my mechanic does is basically whenever you press the left mouse button, whereever the character is facing, there will be a projectile that spawns from the player, 
with said projectile moving away from where the player was facing when the left mouse button was pressed.

After the projectile reaches a certain distance; it gets destroyed.
This projectile can be use to defeat enemies, as well as destroy targets. When the target gets destroyed, it will make blockades that keep the player in the room disappear, allowing the player to go into a new room.
